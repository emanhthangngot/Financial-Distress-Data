- versions: restricted Pod Security, tokenless ServiceAccount, default-deny Calico policies
- command: `kubectl get networkpolicy -n agents-sandbox` and the five negative commands executed from sandbox-negative-probe
- expected_result: drift agent has the same non-root, read-only, tokenless and narrowly scoped controls as feature agent

- redaction_status: reviewed — no token values, credentials or private IPs recorded
